# Health Guard - Multiple Disease Prediction System
This project is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases, including Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease, based on user inputs. The system leverages pre-trained Machine Learning models to provide accurate predictions.

## Features
- Diabetes Prediction: Based on key health metrics such as glucose level, insulin level, and BMI.
- Heart Disease Prediction: Evaluates various factors like age, cholesterol level, and resting blood pressure.
- Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Analyzes voice-related parameters to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit for building the web interface
- Machine Learning Models for disease prediction
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy for data processing and model building
